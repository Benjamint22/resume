      <h1>About me</h1>
      <article>
        <h2>My background</h2>
        <p>
          I learned to program like I learned to speak. I've been a passionate
          developer since I was around nine years old I was home-schooled until
          I was sixteen years old and had almost all day to do whatever I
          wanted; I spent most of that time programming and experimenting with
          various technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          At sixteen years old, I decided to go to adult school so I could get a
          formal education. At nineteen years old, I went to college (c√©gep) in
          computer science then successfully graduated without repeating any
          semester.
        </p>
        <p>
          At twenty-five years old, I immigrated to the United States (legally)
          to live with my wife. I am not a US citizen and I don't require visa
          sponsorship from my job.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h2>My passion</h2>
        <p>
          My passion is overwhelmingly to learn new things, especially things
          related to computers. I especially tend to enjoy things related to
          software development, CI/CD, or infrastructure. There's never enough
          time to do everything I want.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h2>My values</h2>
        <p>
          I value honesty, empathy, and emotional intelligence; I believe they
          are extremely important in most settings, especially a team. I work
          very well with most people.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h2>One of my biggest strengths</h2>
        <p>
          I'm extremely self-sufficient. I grew up too impatient to ask for
          help, wanting to fix my problems myself by searching on Google. I like
          to dig to understand problems and find solutions. I've learned to ask
          for help when needed, but I have no problem figuring things out by
          myself.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h2>My free time</h2>
        <p>
          Outside working hours, I like to research and experiment with various
          technologies. Most often, I research technologies purely for fun or
          curiosity. For instance, in my free time, I've learned how to use:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <mark>Docker</mark> (and <mark>Docker Compose</mark>)
            <ul>
              <li>
                I've been using containers to isolate programs and games running
                on a home server for at-least three years (January 2020).
              </li>
              <li>
                I also installed <mark>Dokku</mark> in a container to deploy
                personal test projects.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <mark>Next.js</mark>
            <ul>
              <li>I used it to create a simple dashboard for a home server.</li>
              <li>
                I also used it to research tooling for a personal project. This
                time, I experimented with server-side/client-side components,
                <mark>NextAuth</mark>, <mark>EdgeDB</mark>, and
                <mark>TypeORM</mark>.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <mark>Rust</mark>
            <ul>
              <li>
                I used it to experiment with smart lights using the
                <mark>UDP protocol</mark>. I made a simple library project to
                detect my smart lights and I used <mark>Clap</mark> to make a
                simple CLI project.
              </li>
              <li>
                Also used it a long time ago to make a very simple API to list,
                start, and stop Linux services on my old home server.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <mark>Google Sheet</mark> and <mark>Google App Script</mark>
            <ul>
              <li>
                I use them frequently to research and make informed decisions.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Software developer, Developer Experience, Coveo</h2>
        <div class="time-span">Since <time datetime="2021-01">2021</time></div>
        <p>
          I spent most of my time working on the Headless web library (built
          with <mark>Redux</mark> and <mark>Typescript</mark>) and the Atomic
          web components library (built with <mark>Stencil</mark> and
          <mark>Typescript</mark>) for building search interfaces. You can see
          the source code and find my contributions here:
          <a href="https://github.com/coveo/ui-kit"
            >https://github.com/coveo/ui-kit</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I wrote end-to-end tests with <mark>Cypress</mark> and I wrote unit
          tests with <mark>Jest</mark>.
        </p>
        <p>I wrote some external documentation.</p>
        <p>
          I tested integrations with other frameworks (such as
          <mark>React</mark>, <mark>Next.js</mark>, <mark>Angular</mark>, and
          <mark>Vue</mark>).
        </p>
        <p>I debugged some client implementations.</p>
        <p>I wrote some design documents.</p>
        <p>
          I learned a lot about allocating the right amount of time and effort
          to the right tasks. There's always a lot more we want to add or
          improve.
        </p>
        <p>
          Working on web libraries frequently involved finding the right balance
          between functionality, maintainability and efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          I answered a lot of questions from clients and support staff, which
          taught me a lot about customer needs, how to help them succeed and how
          to make APIs that are more intuitive to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          I worked a lot on testing and improving accessibility for our Atomic
          component library and our Search UI components library. I learned a
          lot about <mark>WCAG</mark> and wrote internal documentation on how to
          install and test with different screen readers.
        </p>
        <p>
          I worked a lot on tooling and continuous integration for our
          <code>ui-kit</code> repository. I worked a lot with
          <mark>NPM Workspaces</mark> (and dependency hoisting),
          <mark>GitHub Actions</mark>, <mark>Nx</mark> (especially caching),
          semantic versioning strategies and <mark>Git</mark>.

          Most of my time was dedicated to working on the Coveo Search UI web
          components library. I worked extensively with <mark>Typescript</mark>,
          and used <mark>SASS</mark> for styling and <mark>Jasmine</mark> for
          writing unit tests. You can see the source code and find my

        <p>
          I worked on a bit of continuous integration with
          <mark>Jenkins</mark> and <mark>Travis</mark>. I also worked a little
          bit on infrastructure with <mark>Terraform</mark>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wrote and deployed a very small experiment using
          <mark>AWS Elastic Beanstalk</mark> and <mark>DynamoDB</mark>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I worked a little bit on an API made with <mark>Go</mark>, and I
          worked on extracting reference documentation out of it.

        <h2>As a kid, reached Roblox's first page with my game</h2>
        <p>
          Since I was about nine or ten years old, I spent over five years
          programming games in Roblox using Lua. I saved a lot of virtual
          currency in the game over time, and spent a lot of it to advertise my
          games.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually, with the collaboration of my brother who built the entire
          map, we built a small game. I drew a few advertisements and added
          promotional codes to them, ran them overnight and woke up to the game
          on the first Games page of the site.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game was pretty terrible since I didn't add much content and it
          had too many bugs that I didn't know how to fix. The game only stayed
          on the first page for about three days. It was still a really great
          experience.
